STRINGS:
string are classes,arrays are objects.the sequence of characters is called strings
Strings are immutable all the array objects will be created in int memory but strings are created inside heap memory
once a string got created it will be created fixed.it means we cant modify the string
String a="hello";
String b="hello";
System.out.println(a==b);
String a=new String("hello");
String b=new String("hello");
System.out.println( a== b);

System.out.println( a== b);
== used to compare data not address

System.out.println(a.equals(b));
equals is used to compare address

arr.length is a variable or feel
str.length is a value it returns no of parameters.




Back tracking:
-example of recurssion
in recursion we have only two possibilities either if and for else and in backtracking we have multiple possibilities,most of the problems whenever we reach base case we have to print all the base case elements
remove last element in every recursive call
