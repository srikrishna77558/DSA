Max product of subaaray:
[2,3,-6,4]
in the sub array if we have even positive numbers the product will be positive
if we have odd negative numbers product will be negative
in the subarray if we have atleast 0,start your product variable with 1.
if we have negative value the product of prefix value will be positive and suffix of the neagtive element will be positive
Initalize maximum variable.


OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING 


FOUR MAIN PILLARS 

1.INHERITANCE 
2.POLYMORPHISM 
3.ABSTRACTION 
4.ENCAPSULATION 


AND TO ACHIEVE THOSE PROPERTUES THE PRE REQUIREEMENT 

CLASS 
OBJECT 
CONSTRUCTOR AND INTERFACE 


CLASS ;  IS A VIRTUAL ENTITY AND BLUE PRINT FOR OBJECTS
OBJECTS ; INSTANCE OF CLASS 
CONSTRUCTOR ; INTIALIZING THE  OBJECT
IN A OBJECT WE CAN CALL THE METHODS WHICH WHERE PRESENT IN THAT PARTICULAR BY CREATING OBJECT FOT THAT PARTICULAR CALSS 

INTIALIZING CONSTRUCTOR
  1. DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR 
  2 . PARAMETERISED CONSTRUCTOS


FOR EVERY CLASS THERE IS A DEFAULT BACK BENCHER 
FOR A EVERY CLASS THERE IS DEAFULT CONSTRUCTOR 
FOR EVERY CLASS THERE WILL BE UNFORTUNATE FIRST BENCHERS 

 -----INHERITANCE ARE 5 TYPES--------
SINGLE INHT
MULTIPLE INHT
MULTI LEVEL INHT 
HYBRID INHT
HEIRACHACHAL INHT 



SINGLE INHT ; THE PROPERTIES ARE INHERITED FROM TWO CHILD CLASS FROM PARENT CLASS
MULTI LEVEL INHT ; THE PROPERTIES ARE INHERITED FROM TWO PARENT CLASS FROM GRAND CHILD CLASS AND PROPERTIES INHERITED TO CHILD CLASS AND PARENT CLASS
MULTIPLE INHT ; PROPERTIES ARE INHERITED FROM MULTIPLE PARENT CLASS 
HEIRARACHAL INHT ; PROPERTIES ARE INHERITED TO MULTIPLE CHILD CALSSES 


POLYMORPHISM ; SAME METHOD APPEARING MULTIPLE TIMES 
METHOD OVERLOADING  ; IN SAME CLASS IF WE HAVE TWO METHODS WITH SAME NAME  WITH DIFFERENT PARAMETERS WILL CALL IT AS METHOD OVERLOADING 
METHOD OVERRIDING ; IN CHILD CLASS IF WE  DECLARE A METHOD WHICH WERE  PRESENT IN PARENT CLASS  , SAME METHOD NAME AND SAME PARENT CLASS WILL CALL IT AS METHOD OVERRIDING
NOTE ; MAIN METHOD CAN BE OVERWRITTEN WITH DIFFERENT PARAMETERS 
   

INHERITANCE ; USING EXTEND KEYWORD WE CAN INHERIT PROPERTIES FROM CLASSES , USING IMPLEMENT KEYWORD WE CAN INHERIT PROPERTIES FROM INTERFACES 


ENCAPLSULATION ; BINDING METHOD AND DATA AND HIDING SENSTIVE DATA IS CALLED ENCAPSULATION 
IF THE VARIABLES ARE THE PRIVATE WE CANT ACCESES OUTSIDE THE CLASS IF YOU WANT TO ACCESES WE CAN USING METHODS 


ABSTRACTION ; HIDING IMPLEMENTATION SHOWING ESSENTIAL DETAILS 
2 TYPES 
DATA ABSTRACTION 
FUNCTIONAL ABST 
PROCEDURAL ABST 
CONTROL ANST 
IF YOU WANT TO MAKE A METHOD ABSTRACT WE HAVE TO USE ABSTARACT KEYWORD AND IF WE HAVE ABSTRACT METHOD WE HAVE TO MAKE THE CLASS SHOULD BE ABSTRACT CLASS 
FOR ABSTRACT METHOD IS A INCOMPLETE METHOD 

.
INTERFACE ; IT CONTAINS ALL ABSTRACT METHODS , INTERFACE CONTAINS ALL ABSTRACT METHODS AND WE CANT CREATE OBJECT FOR INTERFACE .
